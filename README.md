tob is a small, basic, really slow and naive Brainfuck interpreter written in C++.





I wanted to make it "simple", it use std::map to simulate infinite memory, and thus it's very slow(that's not the only thing that makes it slow...).





It's very very slow and I want to insist on that because I tested the tsoding's Brainfuck interpreter (https://github.com/tsoding/bfjit/) and it was like 25-30 times faster than mine...(the project is called bfjit but you have an option to disable the JIT and that's what I did to test that out)
